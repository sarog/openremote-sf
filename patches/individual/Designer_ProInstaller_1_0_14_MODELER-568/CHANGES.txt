   alert.


Designer 2.11.2 (2012-03-13 Formosa)

   despite there not being serialized Designer state. The lack of serialization
   data should not be flagged as an error in Designer.

   caused by pre-existing serialization data generated by previous Designer
   versions or if there's stil incorrect API use to include paths in image
   source names in current revision. Temporary stop-gap fix included to strip
   the erroneous paths.
