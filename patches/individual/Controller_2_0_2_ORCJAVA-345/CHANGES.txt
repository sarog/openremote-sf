Controller ORCJAVA-345
======================

 - Upgrade WebConsole to tag 2.1.1 (Richard Turner)


Controller 2.0.2 (2013-02-26)
============================

 - Update Web Console implementation to 2.1.0 (Richard Turner, ORCJAVA-312)
 - Bug fix: sensor status cache was throwing a runtime exception
   which was not handled if a panel requested a sensor status on
   a sensor which failed to start (due to configuration or
   other errors). The unhandled exception caused the client
   call to fail instead of gracefully falling back to default or
   error value. (Eric Bariaux, ORCJAVA-268)
 - Bug fix: logging generated errors (null pointer exception) at
   shutdown (Eric Bariaux, ORCJAVA-222)

=============================

 - Update Web Console implementation to 2.0.0 FINAL

   bound (10MB per file) instead of unlimited file
   size logging
