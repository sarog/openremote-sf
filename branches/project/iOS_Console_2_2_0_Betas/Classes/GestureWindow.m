/*
 * UIWindow to intercept touch events as gesture, this doesn't break the event delivery.
 *
 * When the iPhone detects a touch it determines the first responder for that event 
 * by recursively calling hitTest:withEvent: to descend down the tree of UIResponder 
 * objects in the applicationâ€™s window. 
 * The first reponder is then sent the event and can either respond to it 
 * or pass it up the responder chain from view to view controller to parent view.
 * To detect gestures anywhere in the app so I chose to override sendEvent: in UIWindow. 
 * This allowed me to intercept touch events before they were sent to the first responder.
 * See also : http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/EventHandling/EventHandling.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH9-SW9
