/*
 Exception while round-robin happens.
 
 A round robin is an arrangement of choosing all elements in a group equally in some rational order, 
 usually from the top to the bottom of a list and then starting again at the top of the list and so on. 
 A simple way to think of round robin is that it is about "taking turns." 
 Used as an adjective, round robin becomes "round-robin."
 
 failover is the capability to switch over automatically to a redundant 
 or standby server in the same group upon the failure.
 
 when current Controller is not available, 
 console should switch to another Controller in the same group.
