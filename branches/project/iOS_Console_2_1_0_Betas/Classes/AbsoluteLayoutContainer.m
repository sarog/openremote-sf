	 * The returned component instance must be nil, if method [Component buildWithXMLParser] doesn't immediately support latest direct subElements of absolute element 
	 * and wrong direct subElememnts appear in panel.xml.
	 * So, here needs a judgement for nil component instance as the following code.
	 * However, Some description in detail about judgement of nil component instance is neccessary as followiing:
	 * The component is nil, but the delegate of xmlparser is self(absoluteLayoutContainer), so, this delegate method "- (void)parser:(NSXMLParser *)parser didStartElement"
	 * will be called again if the previous metioned "latest direct subElements" and "wrong direct subElememnts" have direct subElements.
	 * And the parameter elementName is the name of direct subElement of previous metioned "latest direct subElement" and "wrong direct subElement".
	 * So, At this time, if the elementName(such as image element) is supported by method "[Component buildWithXMLParser]", 
	 * this returned component isn't nil but a model instance(such as image model), finally the view corresponded to this returned component will be rendered within absoluteLayoutContainerView.
	 * However, please note that the variable component is property of AbsoluteLayoutContainer and elementName built second returned component with isn't
	 * the direct subelement of absolute element in panel.xml. It doesn't make sense that the view corresponded to second returned component is rendered within absoluteLayoutContainerView.
	 * 
	 * So, XmlParser shouldn't be parsing, if direct subElement of absolute element isn't supported,in other word, compoment is nil.
	 * The resolution is assign the parentDelegate(screen) of currentDelegate(AbsoluteLayoutContainer) to xmlParser, 
	 * Because parentDelegate(screen) don't support parsing the second passing elementNames, so the second passing element won't be rendered in screenView either. 
	 * Indeed it works.
