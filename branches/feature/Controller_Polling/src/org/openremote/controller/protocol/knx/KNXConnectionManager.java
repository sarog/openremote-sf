/**
 * The goal of the KNXConnectionManager is to:
 *
 * 1) Isolate the OpenRemote event system from the underlying KNX IP wire protocol library types.
 * 2) Provide a uniform connection management interface for the underlying KNX IP connection
 * 3) Create a higher level functional API on top of the KNX IP wire protocol details
 *
 *
 * <h3>Type Isolation</h3>
 *
 * By isolating the rest of the OpenRemote system from the underlying KNX IP wire library API we
 * enable more transparent upgrades of the wire protocol implementations. Therefore issues with
 * backwards incompatible API development or replacing the KNX IP wire library should not impact
 * the rest of the system.  The KNXConnectionManager implementation should work to prevent type
 * leakage from the underlying wire library implementation to the rest of the system.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Connection Management</h3>
 *
 * Connection management functionality is implemented to deal with the scarce number of KNX
 * connections that are available to common KNX IP gateways. KNX specification requires each
 * IP connection to the gateway to be mapped to a KNX individual address (a.k.a physical address)
 * which is commissioned with ETS [1]. In practice many KNX IP gateways only support commissioning
 * of one or few such individual addresses. This means that the available connections must be
 * shared with all external devices wishing to access the KNX bus. Therefore the connection
 * management functionality should support creation of various policies to implement connection
 * sharing.
 *
 * TODO : connection policies, aggressive, yielding, managed
 *
 *
 * <h3>Functional API</h3>
 *
 * TODO  : see KNXConnection interface
 *
 * [1] TODO
 *

  /*
   * Implementation Notes:
   *
   *  - The current wire protocol library API is Calimero 2.0 Alpha 4. This connection manager
   *    implementation should attempt to prevent any type leakage from Calimero to the rest of
   *    the system to make it easier to upgrade (Calimero breaks API compatibility between 1.x
   *    and 2.x versions and current 2.x implementation is still considered alpha) or switch
   *    the implementation outright if necessary.
   *
   *  - The so-called "connection management" in this first iteration is a simplistic single
   *    permanent connection to IP gateway which is shared by all connection manager clients.
   *    For all KNX IP gateways that only support single individual address comissioned to
   *    incoming connection this means that the ORB hosting this connection manager becomes the
   *    single owner of the IP gateway. Less aggressive connection policies are on the to-do list.
   *
   *  - The purpose of the Connection API is to provide a higher level abstraction that would not
   *    expose the client to the details of KNX protocol frames, including message codes,
   *    cEMI frames, etc. (but there should be a way to get to those lower level details as the
   *    API will only support limited use cases initially)
   *
   *  - The class is designed as effectively immutable, and should therefore be thread-safe.
