 * Immutable container for connection response data (CRD).
 * <p>
 * The CRD structure is returned by a connection response, and contains information
 * regarding the established communication.<br>
 * It contains description data of a specific connection type. A CRD is built up of host
 * protocol independent data and host protocol dependent data, both optional. Refer to the
 * available subtypes for more specific type information.
 * <p>
 * For now, a plain CRD is returned for management connections, since this connection type
 * doesn't require any additional host protocol data.
 * <p>
 * Factory methods are provided for creation of CRD objects.
