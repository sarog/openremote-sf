/**
 * XML reader interface for pull based reading of XML documents.
 * <p>
 * The reader only does non-validating processing, and resolves predefined XML entities.
 * <br>
 * This interface does not support XML namespaces for now, and has no methods for setting
 * and requesting XML reader features/properties.<br>
 * A reader based on pull parsing style only reads a little piece of a document at once,
 * waiting for the user application to request the next chunk of data. So the application
 * controls the progress of reading a XML document. The reader does not create nor
 * maintain a representation of the entire document for the user (like a model parser
 * would).
 * <p>
 * XML reader implementations don't need to be thread safe.
