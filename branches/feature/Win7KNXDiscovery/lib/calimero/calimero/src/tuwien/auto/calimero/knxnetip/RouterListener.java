 * A listener for use with a {@link KNXnetIPRouter}.

 * In routing mode, it is possible that indications sent with KNXnetIPRouter might be
 * looped back by the network stack and received again through a registered listener in
 * {@link KNXListener#frameReceived(tuwien.auto.calimero.FrameEvent)}.<br>
 * Background: a platform's network interface has the option to send multicast
 * datagrams back to the local socket of the sender; setting the socket's loopback mode is
 * only considered as request and does not have to be followed rigorously.<br>
