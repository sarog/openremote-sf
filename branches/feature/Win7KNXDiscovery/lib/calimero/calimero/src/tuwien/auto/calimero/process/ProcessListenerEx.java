/**
 * Extended process listener interface with additional group read event handler methods,
 * as well as basic ASDU type translation capabilities.
 * <p>
 * This listener contains predefined methods equal to the ones in the ProcessCommunicator
 * interface to convert received ASDUs into common java data types.<br>
 * Usage example for group reads from datapoints with DPT main number 1:<br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public void groupWrite(ProcessEvent e)
 * {
 *     // the member variable model (of type DatapointModel, declared by the user)
 *     // contains datapoints of light switch objects in the KNX network (boolean type)
 *     if (model.contains(e.getDestination()))
 *         try {
 *             final boolean switch = asBool(e);
 *             System.out.println(model.get(e.getDestination()).getName()
 *                 + &quot; state = &quot; + switch);
 *             if (switch) {
 *                 // light switch is in position on
 *                 // do some visual feedback for the user ...
 *             }
 *         }
 *         catch (KNXFormatException kfe) { /* DPT not found ... *&lt;!-- --&gt;/ }
 * }
 * </pre>
