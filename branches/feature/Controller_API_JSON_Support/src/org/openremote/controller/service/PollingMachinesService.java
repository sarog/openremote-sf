/**
 * This service is for polling the status of components of hardwares people cared.<br /><br />
 * 
 * There are two steps:<br />
 * 1) While starting up <b>APP SERVER</b>(tomcat), init the <b>STATUSCACHE</b> with all sensor ids parsed from <b>CONTROLLER</b>.xml 
 * and their initialized statuses queried by <b>STATUSCOMMAND</b> from hardware.<br />
 * 2) Create looped threads initialized by <b>STATUSCOMMAND</b>, and these threads will scan the latest statuses of hardware every interval-time. 
 * And then update the statusCache if corresponding status changed.
