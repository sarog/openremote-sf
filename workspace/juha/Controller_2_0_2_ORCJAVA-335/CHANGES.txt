ORCJAVA-335
===========

 - Update telnet implementation to use locale independent string
   case conversions


ORCJAVA-332
===========

 - Updates the core controller classes (excluding protocol 
   implementations, these are updated in separate tasks) to use 
   locale independent string conversions


ORCJAVA-329
===========

 - The controller build script does not mandate an explicit character
   encoding for all Java compiler tasks. This causes issues on some
   systems with incompatible default character set/locale. This patch
   enforces UTF-8 encoding on all compiled source files.


Controller 2.0.2 (2013-02-26)
============================

 - Update Web Console implementation to 2.1.0 (Richard Turner, ORCJAVA-312)
 - Bug fix: sensor status cache was throwing a runtime exception
   which was not handled if a panel requested a sensor status on
   a sensor which failed to start (due to configuration or
   other errors). The unhandled exception caused the client
   call to fail instead of gracefully falling back to default or
   error value. (Eric Bariaux, ORCJAVA-268)
 - Bug fix: logging generated errors (null pointer exception) at
   shutdown (Eric Bariaux, ORCJAVA-222)
 

Controller 2.0.1 (2012-11-21)
=============================

 - Update Web Console implementation to 2.0.0 FINAL
 - Change Tomcat runtime default logging to file size
   bound (10MB per file) instead of unlimited file
   size logging
