Designer 2.12.0 (2012-XX-XX Jura)
=================================

- TODO


Designer 2.11.2 (2012-03-13 Formosa)
====================================

Bug fix release.

 - New accounts may save (empty) controller and panel document instances
   despite there not being serialized Designer state. The lack of serialization
   data should not be flagged as an error in Designer.

 - Certain image sources still include partial file paths. Unclear if this is
   caused by pre-existing serialization data generated by previous Designer
   versions or if there's stil incorrect API use to include paths in image
   source names in current revision. Temporary stop-gap fix included to strip
   the erroneous paths.
 

Designer 2.11.1 (2012-03-12 Formosa)

   may not have made any changes yet when auto-save runs for the first
   time)
