/**
 * An error handler is invoked on problems of a log writer which are not handled by the
 * writer itself.
 * <p>
 * Such problems shouldn't get logged using another log writer, to prevent the possibility
 * of a fault / failure chain, and shouldn't lead to disruption of the logging system at a
 * whole.<br>
 * Moreover, log writer errors most certainly can't be returned back to the owner of the
 * writer responsible for handling the errors. And handling errors directly in log
 * services can rarely be done in a satisfying way.<br>
 * So the associated error handler is used for such error events.<br>
 * The handler itself might be adapted to the application needs. For example, an
 * overridden {@link #error(LogWriter, String, Exception)} might close the log writer the
 * error originated from.
