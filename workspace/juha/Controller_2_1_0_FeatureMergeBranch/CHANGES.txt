  - Lagarto server (panStamps) integration, Daniel Berenguer
  - Support 'custom' sensor types with virtual commands (ORCJAVA-217)
  - KNX: added distinct levels for 'DIM' and 'SCALE' commands that allow

  - HTTP protocol: methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE are now supported.
    For HTTP/JSON return documents, a JSON Path expression is supported.
    Internally, the implementation has been converted to use URIs instead 
    of URLs which resolves an issue with lack of encoding of HTTP parameters 
    which contain which contain white spaces or other special characters
