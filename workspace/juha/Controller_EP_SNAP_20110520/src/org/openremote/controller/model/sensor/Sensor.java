/**
 * Sensors abstract incoming events from devices, either through polling or listening to
 * devices that actively broadcast their state changes. Sensors operate on protocol handlers
 * to execute read requests on devices to fetch the current device state.  <p>
 *
 * Each polling sensor (for passive devices) has a thread associated with it. Sensors bound to
 * event listeners do not create threads of their own but the event listener implementations
 * themselves are usually multi-threaded. <p>
 *
 * Each sensor can have list of properties which it makes available to implementations of
 * read commands and event listeners. These properties may be used by protocol implementers to
 * direct their event producer output values to suit the sensor's configuration. <p>
 *
 * A sensor class is designed as immutable. This immutability should be maintained by the sensor's
 * subclasses in order to make it safe to pass the sensor instances to protocol handlers and
 * possibly to other plugins and/or components.
