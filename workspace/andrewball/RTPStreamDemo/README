This is a simple Android app for demonstrating playing streaming
video over RTSP.  See src/org/openremote/demo/rtpstream/PlayRTPStream.java
for more information as well as to change the URL used.

This started out with the following code fragment given to me
by Juha Lindfors (the licensing of which I don't know):

==
VideoView vv = new VideoView(this);
vv.setMinimumHeight(200);
vv.setMinimumWidth(400);
vv.setBackgroundColor(0xaaaaaa);
MediaController mediaController = new MediaController(this);
mediaController.setAnchorView(vv);
vv.setMediaController(mediaController);
contentLayout.addView(vv);

vv.setVideoURI(Uri.parse("rtsp://video3.americafree.tv/AFTVComedyH2641000.sdp"));
vv.start();
