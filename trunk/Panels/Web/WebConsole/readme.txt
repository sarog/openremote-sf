To run the application from within Eclipse:
- start the controller application (see controller readme.txt for details).
	- make sure the controller is running on the same machine as the Web Console on port 8080.
- create a new google web application by selection "Run|Configurations|Web Application"
	- select the WebConsole project
	- check "Automatically select an unused port" to avoid port conflicts with the controller.
