 NSXMLParser delegate: Parse the returned status XML from polling REST API
 usually a status xml returned from Controller looks like:
 <openremote>
  <status id="1">on</status>
  <status id="2">off</status>
 </openremote>
 
 'id' is sensor id, element body is latest status.
 so here sensor '1' is 'on'; sensor '2' is 'off'.
