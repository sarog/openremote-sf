 |  Build file for compiling and running the Java based integration tests
 |  of native I/O daemon.
 |
 |  Notice that Java is just the language used for the test battery to test the
 |  integration level (socket level) use of OR native I/O daemon - that is,
 |  it *does not* test the Java API and bindings built on top of the socket level
 |  integration on the "JavaServices" side of the equation. In practice this means
 |  that if any changes are made to the tests run by this script then the
 |  corresponding tests on the "JavaServices" side must also be run against the
 |  final executable to guarantee full integration.
